# OOP

In this project we focused on familiarizing ourselves with OOP principles:
- classed based program organization
- inheritance
- polymorphism ( and how it can be achieved via the use of dynamic dispatch )

Also it was a good opprtunity to get  acquainted with the basic syntax and features of the Java programming language

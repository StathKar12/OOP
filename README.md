# OOP

In this project we focused on familiarizing ourselves with OOP principles:
- Classed based program organization
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism ( and how it can be achieved via the use of dynamic dispatch )
- Abstraction
- Encaptulation
- Assosiation
- Aggregation
- Composition

Also it was a good opprtunity to get  acquainted with the basic syntax and features of the Java programming language
